The purpose of life is a life of purpose and what makes a life valuable is the perfect blend of knowledge, skills and values. Most of us simply go through life but in the pursuit of going through life, we forget to grow through life. Therefore the reality is” one cannot upload love, one can’t download time, one can’t google all of the life’s answers therefore one must actually live some of his life.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%;"><p style="text-indent:10px; margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px;">IYF is aimed towards nourishing the hearts of today's youth with the sublime message of the scriptures and helping them flourish in their lives in a wholesome manner.</span>

Most of these revolutions were spearheaded and lead by the youths only. </span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;"><p style="text-indent:10px; margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px;">As India makes rapid advancements in the field of technology and is recognized the world over for its vast and untapped resources, especially the ‘human’ resource, with 55% of the population in the age group of 18-25, the future seems bright. But along with this euphoria, there is also a darker side to the reality; one that finds today’s youth battling with drug and alcoholic addictions, pre and post marital infidelities and mental depressions. Therefore Idyllic Youth Forum has ventured into wisdom literatures with the desire to bring about positive revolutions in the misguided life of modern youths. Now Idyllic Youth Forum has taken a good shape in many prestigious cities of India.</span>
